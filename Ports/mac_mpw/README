This directory contains extra files needed to build stdwin for the Mac
under MPW 2.0.2.  Take these files together with all the files from the
mac subdirectory, plus strdup.c, getopt.c and wtextbreak.c from
elsewhere in the stdwin tree.  The Makefile will build the library.

Disclaimer: this hasn't been tested fully yet -- it is just provided in
case you are stuck with MPW.
