Many of the applications here don't really work.
Some once worked, others are simply unfinished.

Working ones are:

bed		bitmap editor (not too good)
dpv		ditroff previewer
klok		analog clock + alarm; root can set the time by dragging hands
miniedit	simple file editor
repeat		repeatedly run a command and show its output
test		various test programs (no Make.proto's here)
