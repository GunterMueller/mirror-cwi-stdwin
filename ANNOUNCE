What's New in STDWIN 0.9.7
==========================

This release is a temporary measure, needed primarily to support the
upcoming release 0.9.7 of the Python programming language.  It is
still lacking complete and up-to-date documentation.  (Sigh!)

Changes with respect to 0.9.6:

- new drawing functions:
  - wfillcircle(int h, int v, int radius)
  - wxorcircle(int h, int v, int radius)
  - wfillelarc(int h, int v, int hrad, int vrad, int ang1, int ang2)
  - wxorelarc(int h, int v, int hrad, int vrad, int ang1, int ang2)
  - wdrawpoly(int n, short points[n])
  - wfillpoly(int n, short points[n])
  - wxorpoly(int n, short points[n])

- Meta keys are now reported as WE_KEY events instead of being ignored,
  if they aren't menu shortcuts

- new functions in the X11 version only:
  - wgetxwindowid(WINDOW *w) returns the X11 window id of a window
  - wconnectionnumber() returns the X11 connection number (a file
    selector usable in BSD select())

- Ported the Mac version to Think C 5.0

- The alfa version doesn't crash any more when you press ^G

- the print menu in dpv is more easily customizable

- the miniedit demo now displays a watch cursor when it is busy

- mods for porting to AIX

- use str(r)chr instead of (r)index everywhere (or at least in more places)


What's New in STDWIN 0.9.6
==========================

This release is a temporary measure, needed primarily to support the
upcoming release 0.9.2 of the Python programming language.  It is
still lacking complete and up-to-date documentation.

For those who are familiar with STDWIN 0.9.5, here is a summary of the
main changes in version 0.9.6 (of course, a number of bugs were also
fixed).

- Initialization is now separated in argument processing and actual
  initialization.
- Scroll bars can be turned off with an option at window creation time.
- More inquiry functions, e.g., document size, window position.
- Filled and XOR mode drawing of circles and elliptical arcs.
- Polygon drawing (filled, outline and XOR).
- Color drawing.
- Modifier keys (control, shift, meta etc.) are passed in mouse events.
- Closing a window is now indicated by a separate event, WE_CLOSE.
- New event type WE_KEY reports non-ASCII keys and keys with modifiers.
